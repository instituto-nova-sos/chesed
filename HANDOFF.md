## Repository Origin

This repository (`instituto-nova-sos/chesed`) is the canonical home for the rebuild of the SOS Gestao platform. It was created as a clean-start repository after the decision to rebuild rather than refactor the legacy Django system.

**Legacy repository**: `Amadeus-22/SOS-Gestao-Final` (Django 5.2.6 + Jazzmin admin)
**This repository**: `instituto-nova-sos/chesed` (Go + React + PostgreSQL)

## Session 1: Product Discovery and Architecture (2026-04-02)

### What Was Done
1. **Full inspection** of the legacy Django codebase (3 apps, 4 models, 17 permissions, audit logging)
2. **Assessment verdict**: Rebuild recommended — Django Admin cannot support offline-first PWA; no API layer; data model insufficient
3. **Complete documentation suite** created (19 files covering requirements, architecture, domain model, data model, API design, security, roadmap)

### What Was Produced
- 00 through 15: Product and architecture documentation
- CLAUDE.md and CODEX.md: AI agent execution rules
- Original HANDOFF.md: Session summary

## Session 2: Repository Migration (2026-04-02)

### What Was Done
1. **Selective migration** from legacy repo to this clean repository
2. **Documentation adapted** to reference the new repository context (no more "current Django system" language in active docs)
3. **Four new security documents** created (16-19) that did not exist in the legacy repo
4. **Root-level files** created fresh: README.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md

### Files in This Repository

**Created new for this repository:**
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | Fresh project README for Chesed |
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI agent rules (adapted for new repo name and structure) |
| `CODEX.md` | AI agent rules (adapted; references CLAUDE.md at root) |
| `HANDOFF.md` | This file |
| `docs/16-iam-and-access-control.md` | Complete IAM model: roles, permissions matrix, campus isolation, session management |
| `docs/17-security-test-strategy.md` | 4-layer security testing approach with test cases |

| `docs/19-secure-development-standard.md` | Secure coding rules, secret management, CI gates, dependency policy |
| `.gitignore` | Standard Go + React + environment ignores |

**Intentionally left behind (not migrated):**
| File/Directory | Reason |
|----------------|--------|
| All Django source code (`atendimento/`, `ong_manager/`, `users/`) | Legacy stack; not reusable in Go+React |
| Django configuration (`settings.py`, `manage.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`) | Framework-specific |
| Legacy documentation (`GUIA_PRATICO.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `ANALISE_E_MELHORIAS.md`, etc.) | Django-specific operational guides |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies; irrelevant to Go+React |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` | Django-specific; will be recreated for Go+React |
| `staticfiles/`, `static/` | Django admin assets |
| `db.sqlite3` | Legacy development database |
| `.env` | Contains legacy credentials |
| `SEGURANCA_PRODUCAO.md` | Django-specific production security guide |
| `INSTALACAO_RAPIDA.txt` | Django quick-start guide |

---

## Major Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Rebuild in new repo (not refactor in place) | Legacy code provides no reusable value for Go+React; clean repo prevents accidental legacy coupling |
| Flat `docs/` structure | Simple and explicit; all 20 docs are numbered for clear ordering |
| CLAUDE.md and CODEX.md at repo root | AI agents read root-level files first; docs/ copies removed to avoid duplication |
| Keep `00-current-system-assessment.md` as-is | Historical reference; documents what was evaluated and why rebuild was chosen |
| Four new security docs (16-19) | Original docs lacked dedicated IAM, threat model, security testing, and secure dev standards |
| `.gitignore` for Go+React+PostgreSQL | Prevents accidental commit of binaries, node_modules, env files, IDE configs |

## Session 3: Security Architecture Review (2026-04-02)

### What Was Done
1. **Comprehensive security review** of all 19 documentation files from a cybersecurity-first perspective
2. **Critical finding**: Custom JWT authentication identified as the highest-risk architectural decision
3. **IAM decision**: Keycloak selected as external identity provider (OIDC)
4. **14 documents updated** to replace custom auth with Keycloak and strengthen security controls
5. **1 new document created**: `docs/20-keycloak-configuration.md`

### Key Decision: Keycloak as IAM Provider
- **Rationale**: Open-source (Apache 2.0), self-hosted ($5-7/month), zero licensing cost at any scale, standard OIDC (no vendor lock-in), provides MFA/SSO/password policies/brute-force protection out of the box
- **Alternatives rejected**: Auth0/Okta (cost grows with users), AWS Cognito (vendor lock-in), custom JWT (highest security risk)
- **Protocol**: OIDC Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
- **Impact**: Removed 5 custom auth API endpoints, removed `refresh_token` table, removed `password_hash` from `app_user`, added `keycloak_subject_id`

### Documents Updated
| File | Change Type |
|------|-------------|
| `docs/16-iam-and-access-control.md` | Full rewrite — Keycloak OIDC architecture |
| `docs/11-api-design.md` | Major — removed auth endpoints, added OIDC flow |
| `docs/10-data-model.md` | Major — schema changes for Keycloak |
| `docs/05-architecture-proposal.md` | Major — Keycloak in architecture diagram |
| `docs/06-tech-stack-evaluation.md` | Moderate — IAM provider comparison table |
| `docs/13-security-and-compliance.md` | Moderate — session management, WAF, logging, LGPD timeline |
| `docs/18-threat-model.md` | Moderate — updated T1/T7, added T10-T12 |
| `docs/17-security-test-strategy.md` | Moderate — OIDC validation tests |
| `docs/19-secure-development-standard.md` | Moderate — prohibited custom auth, updated deps |
| `docs/14-deployment-strategy.md` | Moderate — Keycloak container, costs, env vars |
| `docs/12-offline-sync-strategy.md` | Moderate — offline tokens, mandatory encryption |
| `docs/15-implementation-guidelines.md` | Minor — approved deps, middleware description |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Minor — Keycloak guardrails |
| `CODEX.md` | Minor — mirrored CLAUDE.md changes |

### New Documents Created
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `docs/20-keycloak-configuration.md` | Realm setup, protocol mappers, MFA config, branding, troubleshooting |

### Security Enhancements Beyond Keycloak
- MFA moved from Phase 3 to Phase 1 (free with Keycloak)
- Mandatory IndexedDB encryption (was optional)
- LGPD breach notification timeline specified (2 business days to ANPD)
- Three new threat scenarios: Keycloak compromise (T10), supply chain (T11), DDoS (T12)
- WAF recommendation (Cloudflare free tier)
- Centralized logging recommendation (Grafana Loki)
- Security headers CI validation
- Keycloak container image scanning in CI

## Open Questions

These need stakeholder input before implementation begins:

1. **International document types**: What identification documents are accepted in each region (Brazil, USA, Europe)?
2. **Service type catalog**: Is the list fixed or admin-configurable?
3. **Consent form content**: Who designs consent form text? System-managed templates or uploaded PDFs?
4. **Donation receipt format**: Legal requirements per country?
5. **Data retention period**: How long to keep records?
6. **Hosting budget**: Confirmed budget? (Estimates: $10-17/month MVP with Keycloak, $55-70/month production)
7. **Multi-region priority**: When is multi-region operation needed?
8. **Volunteer testing**: Can real volunteers test the MVP during development?

## Next Recommended Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Create the Go project skeleton** (`backend/`)
   - `cmd/server/main.go` with chi router
   - `internal/` package structure (config, domain, handler, service, repository, middleware)
   - Health check endpoint (`GET /api/v1/health`)
   - Makefile with standard commands
   - Docker Compose for Go + PostgreSQL + Keycloak

2. **Set up Keycloak**
   - Keycloak container in Docker Compose with `chesed` realm
   - Configure OIDC client for React PWA (public client, PKCE)
   - Configure OIDC client for Go API (confidential, for Admin API access)
   - Add realm roles (ADMIN, COORDINATOR, PROFESSIONAL, SECRETARY, VOLUNTEER)
   - Add custom protocol mappers for `campus_id` and `person_id`
   - Export realm configuration to `keycloak/realm-export.json`

3. **Create the React project skeleton** (`frontend/`)
   - Vite + React + TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS configured
   - PWA manifest and service worker shell
   - keycloak-js adapter integration
   - Base layout component (responsive sidebar + header)
   - ESLint + Prettier configured

4. **Write the first database migrations**
   - `campus` table
   - `person` and `address` tables
   - `app_user` table (with `keycloak_subject_id`, no `password_hash`)
   - `audit_log` table
   - `service_type` table

5. **Set up CI/CD**
   - GitHub Actions: Go test + lint, React build + lint
   - PostgreSQL service container for integration tests
   - Trivy scanning for Keycloak container image

### Short-Term (Phase 1 Sprint 1)

6. Implement Go OIDC middleware using `coreos/go-oidc` (validate Keycloak tokens via JWKS)
7. Implement local user auto-provisioning (first login creates `app_user` from Keycloak `sub` claim)
8. Implement RBAC middleware (roles from Keycloak token claims)
9. Implement audit logging middleware
10. Build React OIDC integration (keycloak-js adapter, protected routes, auth context)
11. Build React layout shell
12. Configure MFA for ADMIN role in Keycloak

### Medium-Term (Phase 1 Sprints 2-4)

10. Person CRUD API + React pages
11. Triage and Attendance API + React forms
12. Offline sync (IndexedDB + push/pull endpoints)
13. Basic reports with CSV export

## Context for Future AI Sessions

When starting a new session on this repository:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (root) for architecture rules
2. Read `docs/07-mvp-scope.md` to understand current priorities
3. Read `docs/09-backlog.md` to find the next story to implement
4. Check `HANDOFF.md` (this file) for the latest status
5. Check `git log` for what has been implemented since this handoff

The documentation suite is designed to be self-sufficient — an AI agent should be able to pick up any story from the backlog and implement it correctly by following the architecture, data model, and API design docs.
